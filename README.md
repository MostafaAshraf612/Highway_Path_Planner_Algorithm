# Highway_Path_Planner_Algorithm
This repository contains a path planning algorithm developed as part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program (version 1.0). The project focuses on generating a trajectory for a vehicle traveling on a highway, represented as a sequence of waypoints that the vehicle is required to follow.
